# Urban Bike Journey

This is very much a work in progress. To get started, install the proper gems
(TODO: use bundler)

```ruby
gem install sinatra shotgun dotenv --no-ri --no-rdoc
```
Add a Google Maps API key to your .env file like this:
`GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY=1234567`

An API key can be obtained at https://code.google.com/apis/console/?noredirect

To start the app, in a console, run `shotgun urbanbikejourney.rb`

In a browser go to localhost:9393

Misc. Notes for now:
